# Execution Timing Inquiry (2025-04-25 21:43:43)

_**User**_

when does this execute?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

This code executes when the service worker intercepts any network request with a URL path that starts with `/features/`. 

The regular expression `/^\/features\/.*$/` matches any URL that begins with "/features/" followed by any characters. When such a request is detected by the service worker, the callback function runs, fetches the resource from the network, logs the response, and returns it to the client.

For this to work, the service worker must be installed, activated, and controlling the page.

Register Capture not working meaning not logging what might be the reason

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Several possible reasons why your `registerCapture` isn't logging:

1. You're in production mode - the logging only happens when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` 

2. No requests are actually matching the `/features/` URL pattern

3. Service worker not properly installed/activated - check browser DevTools > Application > Service Workers to confirm status

4. Service worker logs appear in a different console - check DevTools > Application > Service Workers and click "inspect" link

5. The service worker may have cached an older version - try unregistering existing service workers and reload

6. Network requests to `/features/` routes might be intercepted by another handler before this one

Try adding a `console.log()` outside the conditional check to see if the handler executes at all, and verify your URLs are actually starting with `/features/`.
