I've updated the navigation links in navLinks-utils.tsx to match the features defined in features.ts file. The changes include:

1. Added missing icon imports from lucide-react (FileText, Package, CloudCog, Lock, Share, Hand, Volume2)

2. Updated icons to match those used in features.ts:
   - Speech Synthesis now uses Volume2 icon instead of Mic
   - Speech Recognition now uses Mic icon instead of MicOff
   - Touch Events now uses Hand icon instead of Smartphone
   - Storage now uses Package icon instead of Database
   - File Handling now uses FileText icon instead of FileUp
   - Background Fetch now uses CloudCog icon instead of FileDown
   - Web Auth now uses Lock icon instead of Shield
   - Web Share API now uses Share icon instead of Share2

These changes ensure consistency between the features defined in features.ts and the navigation links in navLinks-utils.tsx, using the same icons across both files.

I've updated the navigation links to match the category structure from the features.ts file. The key changes include:

1. Added missing icon imports (Wifi, Database, Shield, Server, Bell)

2. Reorganized the navigation items to match the exact category names from features.ts:
   - "Device & Media" â†’ "Device Features"
   - "Storage & Network" â†’ "Storage & Data" 
   - "UI & Security" â†’ Split into "Media & UI" and "Security"

3. Updated icons to match those used in features.ts:
   - Local Storage now uses Database icon instead of HardDrive
   - Network Info now uses Wifi icon instead of Network

4. Reordered items within the Device Features category to match the order in features.ts

These changes ensure the navigation structure in navLinks-utils.tsx perfectly aligns with the feature categories defined in features.ts, making the UI consistent throughout the application.

I've updated features.ts to include all the features that were in navLinks-utils.tsx but missing from features.ts. The additions include:

1. Added missing icon imports: Activity, RefreshCw, Radio, Clock, CheckCircle2, Copy, FileCheck, Download

2. Added to Device Features category:
   - Device Orientation - "Detect device orientation changes and positioning"
   - Device Motion - "Track acceleration and rotation rate of the device"

3. Expanded Network & Sync category with 8 new features:
   - Background Sync - "Defer actions until user has stable connectivity"
   - Broadcast Updates - "Communicate between tabs or service workers"
   - Cache Expiration - "Set expiration dates for cached content"
   - Cacheable Response - "Define which responses should be cached"
   - Cache On Demand - "Cache resources on user request for offline use"
   - Copy Response - "Create copies of request responses for future use"
   - Navigation Preload - "Speed up service worker activation with preloaded content" 
   - Same Response - "Return the same response for multiple requests"

The feature count has increased from 19 to 29 features, providing users with a more comprehensive set of PWA capabilities to explore.
