I've separated the features into two distinct categories:

1. Standard Web API features in `featureCategories`:
   - Device Features (Bluetooth, Geolocation, Media, etc.)
   - Storage & Data (Local Storage, File Handling)
   - Network & Connectivity (basic networking features)
   - Media & UI
   - Security

2. Serwist-specific features in `serwistFeatureCategories`:
   - Background Operations (Background Fetch, Background Sync)
   - Caching Strategies (Cache Expiration, Cacheable Response, etc.)
   - Communication & Performance (Broadcast Updates, Navigation Preload)

This separation makes it clear which features are provided by the Serwist service worker library specifically versus standard Web API features available in modern browsers.
