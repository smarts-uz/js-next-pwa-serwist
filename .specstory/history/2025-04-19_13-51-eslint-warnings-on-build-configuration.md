I'll configure Next.js to show ESLint warnings during the build process by updating your `next.config.mjs` file.

---

Read file: next.config.mjs

---

```diff
  });
  
- export default withSerwist({});
+ export default withSerwist({
+   eslint: {
+     dirs: ['.'],
+     ignoreDuringBuilds: false,
+     // Show warnings in the console during build
+     quiet: false,
+   },
+ });
```

---

I've updated your Next.js configuration to show ESLint warnings during the build process. The changes include:

1. Added an `eslint` configuration object to the exported config
2. Set `dirs: ['.']` to check all directories in your project
3. Set `ignoreDuringBuilds: false` to ensure ESLint errors don't get ignored during builds
4. Set `quiet: false` to make sure warnings are displayed in the console

Now when you run `npm run build`, ESLint warnings will be shown in the console output rather than being suppressed.
