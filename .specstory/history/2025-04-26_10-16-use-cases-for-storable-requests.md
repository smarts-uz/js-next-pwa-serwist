StorableRequest in Serwist (and previously in Workbox) has several important use cases:

1. Background Sync - Store requests when offline to replay them later when connectivity is restored
2. Request Queue Management - Serialize network requests to persist them in IndexedDB for retry/replay
3. Offline Form Submissions - Save form submissions when a user is offline and send them when back online
4. Request Buffering - Store requests during service worker updates or maintenance periods
5. Cross-Origin Request Handling - Serialize requests that need to be handled across different origins or contexts
6. Analytics Event Buffering - Store analytics events when offline for later transmission

The code example is demonstrating how to serialize/deserialize a Request object:
1. Convert a Request to a StorableRequest
2. Convert to a plain object (which can be stored in IndexedDB)
3. Later reconstruct the original Request from the stored data

This pattern enables reliable handling of network operations in offline-first Progressive Web Apps.
