---

I'll fix the invalid configuration option in your Next.js config.

---

```diff
      dirs: ['.'],
      ignoreDuringBuilds: false,
-     quiet: false,
    },
  });
```

---

The invalid `quiet` option has been removed from your Next.js configuration. The ESLint configuration now only includes the valid options: `dirs` and `ignoreDuringBuilds`.
